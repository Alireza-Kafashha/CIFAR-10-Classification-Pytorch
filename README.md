# CIFAR-10 Classification with PyTorch

This project implements an image classification model using PyTorch to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The dataset is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.

## üìÅ Repository Contents

- `Computer_Vision (1).ipynb`: A complete Jupyter notebook that covers:
  - Loading and preprocessing CIFAR-10 data using `torchvision`
  - Defining a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with PyTorch
  - Training the model using a loss function and optimizer
  - Evaluating performance on the test set

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.6+
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- Jupyter Notebook

You can install dependencies using pip:

pip install torch torchvision notebook


### Run the Notebook

1. Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/Alireza-Kafashha/CIFAR-10-Classification-Pytorch.git
cd CIFAR-10-Classification-Pytorch


2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook

3. Open `Computer_Vision (1).ipynb` and run all cells to train and evaluate the CNN.

## üìä Results

After training, the model achieves around **X%** test accuracy.
*Replace `X%` with the actual accuracy obtained after training.*
